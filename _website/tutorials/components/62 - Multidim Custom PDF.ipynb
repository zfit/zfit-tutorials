    "This tutorial is about handling multiple dimensions when creating a custom PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences are marginal since the ordering is handled automatically. It is on the other hand crucial to understand the concept of a `Space`, most notably `obs` and `axes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user (1someone who instantiates the PDF) only knows and handles observables. The relative order does not matter, if a data has observables a and b and a pdf has observables b and a, the data will be reordered automatically.  Inside a PDF on the other hand, we do not care at all about observables but only about the ordering of the data, the *axis*. So any data tensor we have, and limits for integration, normalization etc. **inside** the PDF is order based and uses *axes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When passing the observables to the init of the PDF (as a user), each observable is automatically assigned to an axis corresponding to the order of the observable. The crucial point is therefore to communicate to the user which *axis* corresponds to what. The naming of the observables is completely up to the user, but the order of the observables depends on the pdf. Therefore, the correspondance of each axis to it's meaning has to be stated in the docs."
