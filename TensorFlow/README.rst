TensorFlow and friends
=======================

TensorFlow is a high performance computing library that is mainly
used for Machine Learning on large datasets.

It also serves as the backend of zfit as it allows to
speedup and parallelize computations through different
techniques.

This tutorials cover TensorFlow as a computing engine.
