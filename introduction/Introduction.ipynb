Therefore, we will discuss two libraries in this tutorial: zfit to build models, data and a loss, minimize it and get a fit result and hepstats, to use the loss we built here and do inference.\n",

    "Building models is by far the largest part of zfit. We will therefore cover an essential part, the possibility to build custom models, in an extra chapter. Let's start out with the idea that you define your parameters and your observable space; the latter is the expected input data.\n",

    "There are two types of models in zfit:\n",
    "- functions, which are rather simple and \"underdeveloped\"; their usage is often not required.\n",
    "- PDF that are function which are normalized (over a specified range); this is the main model and is what we gonna use throughout the tutorials.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where a and b define the normalization range (`norm_range`), over which (by inserting into the above definition) the integral of the PDF is unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "zfit has a modular approach to things and this is also true for models. While the normalization itself (e.g. what are parameters, what is normalized data) will already be pre-defined in the model, models are composed of functions that are transparently called inside. For example, a Gaussian would usually be implemented by writing a Python function `def gauss(x, mu, sigma)`, which does not care about the normalization and then be wrapped in a PDF, where the normalization and what is a parameter is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, we can go far by using simply functions (e.g. [TensorFlowAnalysis/AmpliTF](https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF) by Anton Poluektov uses this approach quite successfully for Amplitude Analysis), but this design has limitations for a more general fitting library such as zfit (or even [TensorWaves](https://github.com/ComPWA/tensorwaves), being built on top of AmpliTF).\n",
    "The main thing is to keep track of the different ordering of the data and parameters, especially the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple Gaussian PDF. We already defined the `Space` for the data before, now we only need the parameters. This are a different object than a `Space`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter\n",
    "A `Parameter` (there are different kinds actually, more on that later) takes the following arguments as input:\n",
    "`Parameter(human readable name, initial value[, lower limit, upper limit])` where the limits are recommended but not mandatory. Furthermore, `step_size` can be given (which is useful to be around the given uncertainty, e.g. for large yields or small values it can help a lot to set this). Also, a `floating` argument is supported, indicating whether the parameter is allowed to float in the fit or not (just omitting the limits does _not_ make a parameter constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters have a unique name. This is served as the identifier for e.g. fit results. However, a parameter _cannot_ be retrieved by its string identifier (its name) but the object itself should be used. In places where a parameter maps to something, the object itself is needed, not its name."

    "PDFs provide a few useful methods. The main features of a zfit PDF are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pdf`: the normalized value of the PDF. It takes an argument `norm_range` that can be set to `False`, in which case we retrieve the unnormalized value\n",
    "- `integrate`: given a certain range, the PDF is integrated. As `pdf`, it takes a `norm_range` argument that integrates over the unnormalized `pdf` if set to `False`\n",
    "- `sample`: samples from the pdf and returns a `Data` object"

However, this may not even be required often! They can be added just like numpy arrays and interact well with Python and Numpy:"

    "So far, we have only looked at normalized PDFs that do contain information about the shape but not about the _absolute_ scale. We can make a PDF extended by adding a yield to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the new, extended PDF does **NOT change**, any methods we called before will act the same. Only exception, some may require an argument _less_ now. All the methods we used so far will return the same values. What changes is that the flag `model.is_extended` now returns `True`. Furthermore, we have now a few more methods that we can use which would have raised an error before:\n",
    "- `get_yield`: return the yield parameter (notice that the yield is _not_ added to the shape parameters `params`)\n",
    "- `ext_{pdf,integrate}`: these methods return the same as the versions used before, however, multiplied by the yield\n",
    "- `sample` is still the same, but does not _require_ the argument `n` anymore. By default, this will now equal to a _poissonian sampled_ n around the yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SumPDF` now does not strictly need `fracs` anymore: if _all_ input PDFs are extended, the sum will be as well and use the (normalized) yields as fracs\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way to create an extended PDf is to use `PDF.create_extended(yield)`. However, since this relies on copying the PDF (which may does not work for different reasons), there is also a `set_yield(yield)` method that sets the yield in-place. This won't lead to ambiguities, as everything is supposed to work the same."
