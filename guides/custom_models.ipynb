Instead of inheriting from `BasePDF`, we can use the `BaseFunctor` that contains a mixin which handles daughter PDFs correctly.\n",

There can still be parameters (as for example the `fracs` for the sum) that describe the behavior of the models but they can also be omitted (e.g. for the product). _Sidenote: technically, a normal `BasePDF` can of course also have no parameters, however, since this is a constant function without dependencies, this will rarely be used in practice."
