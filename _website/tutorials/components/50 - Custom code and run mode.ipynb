It is mainly based on TensorFlow for it's computations, which offers many advantages in terms of performance. While this is similar in nature to Numpy, some things are maybe not possible to implement and a fallback can be done.\n",

    "## Defining computations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a lot of flexibility as a programming language. In model fitting, much of this flexibility is though not needed. Fitting using a NLL with a dataset and a Gaussian is a straightforward process: a mathematical definition of a computation that is repeated many times, varying the parameters until the minimum is found.\n",
    "The expression always stays the same. But in fact, we could split things into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    " - defining the computation: we build our model, whether it's a Gaussian or something more complicated by sticking together models. Creating the NLL with the data and the model results in a well defined expression. From now on, there is no need to change this expression (in the vast majority of cases) and it can be 'cached'\n",
    " - running: using our definition, we now need to do the actual calculation. Change the parameters, and calculate again. In this step, we do not need to redefine the computational expression, this stays the same. Just the values change.\n",
    "\n",
    "_If_ we can split our process into this two parts (and we mostly can), the first part has to be run only once, can be optimized (even using many resources as it is a one-time process) and then it can be executed many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we may have completely dynamic things, a model that changes it's components after every minimization. While unlikely, let's assume there is a case. Then we would need to rerun the model building every time, which is rather costly but this is the inherent price of it.\n",

    "## Graph vs Eager\n",

    "\n",
